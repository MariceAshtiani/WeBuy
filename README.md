# WeBuy

WeBuy is an online auction-site created for anyone who has anything to sell, and here they can sell it from wherever they are!

## Description

This is a project for my Semester Project at Noroff. It is an online auctioning website where everyone with a noroff-email are able to view and search trough auctions created by others, and also enlist their own items to sell!
It is a page created for everyone, but mostly students/adults that are interested in reusable items and hidden treasures.
